                <p>Dear Classmates,</p>
                <p>I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to bring your attention to an important matter that requires
                    our immediate action. It's time for us to fill out the Course Evaluation.</p>
                <p>The Course Evaluation is a special opportunity for us to evaluate our instructors and provide
                    valuable feedback on their teaching. It's our chance to voice our opinions and influence positive
                    changes in our courses. However, time is running out, and the deadline is approaching fast. We need
                    to act quickly!</p>
                <p>Some of our instructors may have shortcomings in their teaching methods. They may lack in providing
                    timely feedback, be unresponsive to our emails, deliver unengaging lectures, or assign tasks that
                    are incompatible with MacOS.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the department labs with Windows computers are only accessible until a certain hour,
                    leaving many students, especially those using MacOS, in a difficult situation to find a compatible
                    computer for their assignments.</p>
                <p>By filling out the Course Evaluation, we can put pressure on the instructors to update their courses,
                    address these issues, and provide more flexibility in certain course aspects. Our feedback is
                    crucial in ensuring a better learning experience for all of us.</p>
                <p>Let's join forces and make our voices heard. Don't miss this opportunity to create a positive change
                    in our education. Fill out the Course Evaluation today and let's make a difference together!</p>
                <p>Dodge the Satan with being CEITian.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
