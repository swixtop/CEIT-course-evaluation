                <p>Dear Classmates,</p>
                <p>The Course Evaluation is a special opportunity for us to evaluate our instructors and provide
                    valuable feedback on their teaching. It's our chance to voice our opinions and influence positive
                    changes in our courses. However, time is running out, and the deadline is approaching fast. <b>We need
                    to act quickly!</b></p>
                <p>Some of our instructors may have shortcomings in their teaching methods. They may lack in providing
                    timely feedback, be unresponsive to our emails, deliver unengaging lectures and assignments.</p>
                <p>By filling out the Course Evaluation, we can push them address these issues, and provide more flexibility in certain course aspects. Our feedback is
                    crucial in ensuring a better learning experience for all of us.</p>
                <p>Let's join forces and make our voices heard. Don't miss this opportunity to create a positive change
                    in our education. Fill out the Course Evaluation today and let's make a difference together!</p>
                <p><b>"Dodge the Satan, be a CEITian!"</b></p>
                <p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
